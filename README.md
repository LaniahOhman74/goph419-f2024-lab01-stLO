Examine the use of Taylor series and analysis of error in numerical approximations
Determine the minimum and maximum launch angle ranges
In particular changes in the min and max launch angles over a range of altitudes, keeping the velocity constant, and again for a range of velocities, keeping the altitudes constant 
This allowed us to determine the effect of velocity and altitude on the launch angles and vice versa
